# Iris Flower Classification with Neural Network

This project classifies Iris flowers into three species using a simple feed-forward neural network implemented in PyTorch.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for classification tasks, containing 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Model
The neural network model has:
- Input layer: 4 neurons (one for each feature)
- Hidden layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 3 neurons with Softmax activation

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas torch scikit-learn matplotlib
